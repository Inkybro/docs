# Each binding

**NOTE:** Currently, one is not able to set the value of an HTML ```id``` attribute with Volt. This will be changed in the future. Learn more here.

For iteration over objects, you can use ```.each```

```html
{{ _items.each do |item| }}
  <p>{{ item }}</p>
{{ end }}
```

Above, if ```_items``` is an array, the block will be rendered for each item in the array, setting ```item``` to the value of the array element.

You can also access the position of the item in the array with the #index method.

```html
{{ each _items do |item| }}
  <p>{{ index }}. {{ item }}</p>
{{ end }}
```

Note: This will be switched to each_with_index

For the array: ```['one', 'two', 'three']``` this would print:

    0. one
    1. two
    2. three

You can do ```{{ index + 1 }}``` to correct the zero offset.

When items are removed or added to the array, the ```each``` binding automatically and intelligently adds or removes the items from/to the DOM.
